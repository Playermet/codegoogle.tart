/** The iterator interface. An iterator has a 'next' method which returns
    either the next value in the sequence, or 'Nothing' to indicate the
    end of the sequence.
    
    Concrete iterator types may also want to derive from "HasLength" if
    the length of the sequence is known at construction time.
